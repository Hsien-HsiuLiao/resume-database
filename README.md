# resume-database


• Collaborated with managers in creating a Lotus Notes database using Lotus Designer to facilitate the process of searching through resumes, setting up interviews for potential candidates, and evaluating the candidates.
• Created navigator to allow end user to select what view of resumes they would like to see
• Created fields on resumes that would allow managers to decide how to categorize the resumes (ex. not interested, setup interview, make offer)
• Created form with fields and checkboxes to evaluate candidates and then mail to appropriate people
• Setup ACL levels for the different types of users that will be accessing the database
